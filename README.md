dtrace
======
This repository is a combination of scripts produced by Kirill D. from Nexenta and folks from Joyent, as well as my own additions/modifications/changes to some of their original works and my own of course. Please, feel free to use and change, but be sure you know what you are doing. Dtrace is safe, and none of the scripts here are known to cause issues, but caution is always advised.
